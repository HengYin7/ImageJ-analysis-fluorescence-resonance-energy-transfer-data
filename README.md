# ImageJ-analysis-fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer-data
These two codes are used to analysis the fluorescence resonance enenrgy transfer images.
How to use:
1. Intall this two macros;
2. Run 'multiple combined ND' to convert 'ND' files to multiple TIFF images, the images should be exported to the same folder;
3. Run 'batchscv fit' to convert TIFF images to CSV data, the CSV data should be exported to the same folder;
4. Analysis the CSV data based on your experimental requirment.
